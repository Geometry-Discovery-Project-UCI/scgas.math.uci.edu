There are corresponding problems related to other settings, e.g., $p$-sum and mixed bodies. The $L^p$-Minkowski problem is a special case which has attracted extensive attention where Monge-Ampere equation plays key role. The other cases are more challenging and less understood, the main issue is the convexity of solutions to Hessian type fully nonlinear equations.  We will discuss some recent progresses and related open problems."

This setup extends to the case of noncollapsed spaces with lower Ricci curvature bounds, where one can show the regular set has a (topological) manifold structure.  Together with Brue and Semola we show the top boundary stratum S^{n-1} of the singular set must also be a manifold away from a set of codim 2.  Monotone quantities are not rigid identifiers of manifold points in this case, and the proof requires new techniques.  This in particular answers some conjectures of Kapovitch/Mondino.  Along the way we will study some other rigidity phenomena which behave as a boundary version of volume convergence.",
