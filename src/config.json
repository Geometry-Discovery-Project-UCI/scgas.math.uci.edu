                "abstract": "The Ricci flow (with surgery) has proven to be a powerful tool in the study of 3-dimensional topology — its most prominent application being the verification of the Poincaré and Geometrization Conjectures by Perelman about 20 years ago. Since then further research has led to a satisfactory understanding of the flow and surgery process in dimension 3.\n\nRecently there has been some progress on Ricci flow in higher dimensions, in the form of a new compactness and partial regularity theory. This theory relies on a new geometric perspective on Ricci flows and provides a better understanding of the singularity formation and long-time behavior of the flow. In dimension 4, in particular, this theory may eventually open up the possibility of a surgery construction or a construction of a \"flow through singularities”.\n\nIn the first part of the talk, will describe this new theory, the new geometric intuition that lies behind it and its implications on the study of singularities in dimension 4. In the second part, I will present new work (joint with Eric Chen) that concerns the resolution of conical singularities.",

The Higgs-Coulomb correspondence relates (1) GLSM invariants which are virtual counts of holomorphic curves in the critical locus of the superpotential (Higgs branch), and (2) Mellin-Barnes type integrals on the Lie algebra of G (Coulomb branch). In this talk, I will describe the correspondence when G is a torus, and explain how to use the correspondence to study dependence of GLSM invariants on the stability condition. This is based on joint work with Konstantin Aleshkin."

This setup extends to the case of noncollapsed spaces with lower Ricci curvature bounds, where one can show the regular set has a (topological) manifold structure.  Together with Brue and Semola we show the top boundary stratum S^{n-1} of the singular set must also be a manifold away from a set of codim 2.  Monotone quantities are not rigid identifiers of manifold points in this case, and the proof requires new techniques.  This in particular answers some conjectures of Kapovitch/Mondino.  Along the way we will study some other rigidity phenomena which behave as a boundary version of volume convergence.",
