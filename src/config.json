There are corresponding problems related to other settings, e.g., <span v-katex>$p$</span>-sum and mixed bodies. The <span v-katex>$L^p$</span>-Minkowski problem is a special case which has attracted extensive attention where Monge-Ampère equation plays a key role. The other cases are more challenging and less understood, the main issue is the convexity of solutions to Hessian type fully nonlinear equations. We will discuss some recent progresses and related open problems."            },

In dimension 3, this becomes the existence of conformal embeddings of surfaces into constant sectional curvature space forms, with prescribed mean curvature. We will show existence of such conformal embeddings near generic Einstein background. We will also discuss the existence question in higher dimensions, where things become more subtle and a stability boundary condition is used to construct metrics with nonpositive Einstein constant."
