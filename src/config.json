There are corresponding problems related to other settings, e.g., $p$-sum and mixed bodies. The $L^p$-Minkowski problem is a special case which has attracted extensive attention where Monge-Ampere equation plays key role. The other cases are more challenging and less understood, the main issue is the convexity of solutions to Hessian type fully nonlinear equations.  We will discuss some recent progresses and related open problems."
